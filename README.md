# NeuralFlappyBird

This will be my rendition of the overdone "make a neural net to do flappy bird". To make it a bit of a challenge, I'll be doing it in C. The way I see it, there's 2 steps to this project:
<ol>
	<li> Make flappy bird in C.</li>
	<li> Make a neural network in C.</li>
	<li> Teach the neural network to play flappy bird (in C lol). 
</ol>
